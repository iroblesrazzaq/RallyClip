## 2026-07-03 — Doc harness created in this worktree (RallyClip-perf)

- **What:** AGENTS.md + features.json + docs/{REPO_MAP,PROGRESS,DECISIONS,ENVIRONMENT,testing}.md
  live at the root of this repo, committed on `refactor/runtime-api-engine`.
- **Why:** RallyClip-perf is where active work happens (latest commits, clean tree);
  the container dir (`rallyclip_container/`) is not a git repo, so the harness must
  live inside a repo to be versioned. Container-level context stays in the container
  `CLAUDE.md`; REPO_MAP links to it.
- **Rejected:** harness at container level (unversionable without a new git repo
  wrapping four checkouts — nested-repo mess); harness in `RallyClip/` (parked on
  `docs`, not where work happens; shares `.git` anyway).
- Structural choices made while scanning: replaced the old generic root `AGENTS.md`
  (repo-guidelines boilerplate, partly stale — e.g. claimed yolov8s default) and
  folded root `ENVIRONMENT.md` into `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` so Tier-1 docs have one
  home. `TODO.md` kept as Tier-4 idea pile; current state lives in PROGRESS.md.
  Lint: no config exists and CI doesn't lint → documented scoped-lint convention
  (23 legacy ruff errors recorded in testing.md) instead of adding a lint config
  (that would be a behavior change beyond a docs harness).
- Test interpreter standardized on `../RallyClip/.venv-train/bin/python3` because it
  was verified in-session (212 passed); container CLAUDE.md's `tennis_env` note kept
  as an unverified alternative.
